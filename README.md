# MRSA Project

This is the code for the project https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/102743v1.

# Description

## Variant annotation

The goal of this pipeline is to perform variant calling on long-read (e.g. Oxford Nanopore ONT technologies) sequencing data against a reference bacterial genome of interests. The program generated multiple alignment files in the .SAM and .BAM format. Additionally, it includes two steps to functionally annotate the bacterial genomes using multiple reference genome databases. This can help match in which genes the variants tends to occur.

## RNA-seq

The purpose of the RNA-seq pipeline is to map short-reads transcript onto reference genomes, count transcripts across the different treatments. The data is processed using DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes between treatments.

## Phage annotations
